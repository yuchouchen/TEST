## How to prepare the tidy data required in "Getting and Cleaning Data" course for the Course Project
This README is for anyone who needs to understand the 'run_analysis.R' briefly.

* Input: 
Here are the data for the project: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

* Output:
run_analysisOutput.txt

* Main program
The 'run_analysis.R' does the following (extracted from the Source below):
<ol>
<li>1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.</li>
<li>4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>

For more detail, please refer the comments added in 'run_analysis.R'.
